# Obby
## About
Meet Obby. It is an assistive device for when playing the video game, Minecraft: Java Edition. It has many functionalities such as:
 - Compass to tell what direction the user is facing
 - LED light that turns on when swimming
 - RGB LED light that changes colours based on your hunger (low hunger = red, medium hunger = yellow, high hunger = green)
 - Food Reminder Buzzer that buzzes when your hunger bar is under six points.

## Feasibility
### List of Components
 - Servo Motor; will rotate based on direction player is facing
 - LEDs; used to alert the player when performing the swimming action
 - RGB LED; used to monitor the hunger bar level of the player
 - Buzzer; will alert the player when hunger is below a certain value
 - Arduino Uno; controls the servo motor as well as the LEDs
 - Wires, resistors, breadboard etc. 
The Obby design was based around the components available to us at this time due to the pandemic. 

### Explanation of Feasibility
After many revisions, we decided to go with the idea of using gameplay in Minecraft to show statistics in real life. In other words, it will be the player’s assistant. Our new project will be capable of performing many fascinating tasks like indicating when the player’s health or food bar is low (with the help of LED’s and a buzzer), showing which direction the player is facing, and when the player is in water. We believe this is possible to create since we already have an idea on how to make it. All of our materials which include a servo motor, LED, RGB LED, and a buzzer are all available. As a team, we hope to successfully create this challenging project.  
Schedule/Outline:

### Collaboration and Rationale
As there are several components to this project, the group members who were originally going in class will focus on both the hardware components and writing the Arduino code. The hardware can be made with what little components members have available to them home while the Arduino code may be done virtually. The group members who are in cohort C along with Ayush and Sam will be working on creating the minecraft plugin required for functionality. Each team member will have a grand role in the final project as they are assigned specific tasks to complete, which are listed below. In this virtual format, vans.js will work in a collaborative environment where group members will passionately offer advice, seek feedback from others, and build onto each other's ideas in order to ensure success. By the end, we aim to bring together the work that we have completed - in terms of both software and hardware - and collectively construct a final, fully-functional prototype.
